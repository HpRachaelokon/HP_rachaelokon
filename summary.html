<p>The Web gives users access to a vast array of documents that are connected to each other by means of hypertext or hypermedia links—i.e.,hyperlinks, electronic connections that link related pieces of information in order to allow a user easy access to them.<p>


<p>The World Wide Web is based on several different</p> <p>technologies: Web browsers, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</p>
<h5> components of the web</h5>
 <ul>
   <li>Uniform Resource Locator (URL):serves as system for resources on web.</li>
 </ul>
<p>Every time you click a link on a website or type a web address into your browser, it’s a URL.URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.Every URLbegins with the scheme. This tells your browser what type of address it is so the browser connects to it correctly. There are many types of schemes, but for typical web browsing you will mostly see http and https.</p> 
<p><strong>File path
The file path—often just called thepath—tells your browser to load a specific page. If you don’t specify apathand only enter adomain name, your browser is still loading a specific page; it’s just loading a default page, which usually will help you navigate to other pages.</strong></p>
